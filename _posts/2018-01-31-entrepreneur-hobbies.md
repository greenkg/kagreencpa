The 9-5 life leaves little room for family, friends, hobbies, and all those other things that put a smile on our faces. Oftentimes, work continues into the evenings and the weekends, putting unwanted constraints on our precious and much-needed downtime. And let’s not even get started on the endless commuting hours!

One of the biggest benefits of owning and running your own business is the flexibility it allows you. Working on your own time means managing your own schedule and answering to only yourself, not an overly-demanding manager or that sharp-tongued supervisor. And, let’s be honest here, every office has one of those!

Many entrepreneurs will tell you that not only does working for themselves make them more productive and driven, but that they have more time in their lives for the things that matter to them most. One of my favorite hobbies is horseback riding. The freedom to be able to do this, not only on the weekends but also during the week, is one of the reasons why I started my own business. Leisure activities play an important role in our physical and emotional health and they go some way toward improving our mental acuity and productivity.

All of this is not to say that running your own business is a walk in the park – or in my case a ride in the park. I won’t downplay the fact that getting started as an entrepreneur can be tricky at first, especially when all the pieces of your new venture are still coming together. In fact, there may be times when you will feel bogged down by all the details and wondering why you chose this path in the first place. Don’t panic, we’ve all been there.

They say that the devil is in the details – and they’re not wrong. One of the most important things that new entrepreneurs and newly-formed small businesses must attend to are finances and bookkeeping. And as successful owners and managers will tell you, it’s important to be able to account for every last cent.

Not all people are suited to the level of nitpicking exactness that good bookkeeping entails. If you’re the type of person who’s better at the bigger picture, then it can be beneficial to you to outsource the financial aspects to a professional, leaving you to focus on clients and gaining traction with your venture.

Not only does this mean you’ll have more free time to go and do some of your own favorite leisure activities, but good financial planning and bookkeeping can actually save your business money in the long run.

Do you have a favorite hobby that you’d like to spend more time doing instead of squinting at endless rows of numbers?
