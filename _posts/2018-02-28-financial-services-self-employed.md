As a self-employed individual or business owner, all of the financial decisions for the business are in your hands. Do you need to get an EIN and set up a bank account? Do you need a tax accountant? Do you need a bookkeeper? What about other financial issues that you haven’t even considered?

Finding a CPA that you trust and who communicates well with you is a great first step towards making these decisions. Since you will need to file your taxes anyway, a CPA is a good first hire in your business support team.

Choose carefully! A low-cost CPA may file your return at year end, and provide no additional guidance or support. On the other hand, a full-service accounting firm may offer everything from bookkeeping to budgeting advice, and will keep up with you during the year to make sure they’re giving you the information you need to make decisions.
