From https://simpleit.rocks/ruby/jekyll/tutorials/how-to-add-bootstrap-4-to-jekyll-the-right-way/
All the variables defined in Bootstrap 4 have the !default**[^scss_default] property at the end.
When Jekyll process each Scss file, it only defines the variables that do not have been assigned any value yet,
so we can define Bootstrap's variables before Bootstrap itself define them. It is important to do this before
importing the variables because there are many of them depending on each other to calculate CSS properties values.
